# MobileNet Classifier Demo App (iOS)

## Overview

The classifier application is developed in Swift and showcases*on-device machine learning (ML) capabilities using Apple's Core ML framework. The app allows users to capture an image with the device's camera and instantly classifies the objects present using the [MobileNet Classifier](https://www.kaggle.com/models/google/mobilenet-v2?select=saved_model.pb).

## Example Classification

The application provides a primary label (as seen on the device screen) and detailed scores for the top five predictions (available in the Xcode console):
